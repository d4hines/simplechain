# Simple Chain

A playground for building and testing simple blockchains with different consensus algorithms.

- Testing and simulation framework: [Tenderbatter](https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/tenderbake-simulator) 🧁
- Package management: Nix ❄️
- P2P gossip: [Pollinate](https://github.com/marigold-dev/pollinate) 🐝
- Crypto primitives borrowed from https://github.com/marigold-dev/deku 🪛

## Consensus Algorithms
- Dolev-strong - see [README](./src/consensus/dolev_strong/README.md)
- Tendermint (TODO) 
- Hotstuff-sync (TODO)
